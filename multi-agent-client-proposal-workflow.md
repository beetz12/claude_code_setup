## Detailed Workflow

### Phase 0: Setup and Initialization

```bash
# Create proposal structure
mkdir -p ./proposal/{analysis,sections,drafts}
PROPOSAL_ID="PROP-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Set up chat room
ROOM_NAME="proposal-generation-$PROPOSAL_ID"

# Chat message standards
[ANALYZING] Processing [document/requirement]
[WRITING] Creating [section name]
[COSTING] Calculating [component] costs
[PHASE] Defining Phase [N]: [description]
[COMPLETE] [Agent] finished [deliverable]
[REVIEW] [Finding/Issue]
[APPROVED] Proposal ready for client
```

### Phase 1: Feature Analysis and Prioritization

#### Step 1.1: Launch Feature Prioritization Agent
```
mcp__ccm__claude_code:
  model: "sonnet"
  prompt: |
    You are the Feature Prioritization Agent for proposal generation.
    
    Join chat "$ROOM_NAME" as "FeaturePrioritizer"
    
    1. Read comprehensive-requirements-document.md
    2. Read integrated-research-findings.md
    3. Read all research reports (market, technical, UX, compliance)
    4. Analyze ALL identified features from requirements
    5. CRITICAL: Select subset that fits $20k budget and 2-month timeline
    
    Selection criteria (in priority order):
    1. Core business value - Without this, product has no value
    2. Technical feasibility within constraints
    3. User must-haves from research
    4. Competitive differentiation
    5. Implementation complexity vs value ratio
    
    CRITICAL: Use AI-assisted development time estimates:
    - Simple CRUD feature: 0.5-1 day (vs 3-5 days traditional)
    - Complex feature with integrations: 2-3 days (vs 8-10 days traditional)
    - Basic UI/forms: 0.25-0.5 days (vs 2-3 days traditional)
    - API endpoints: 0.5-1 day for full CRUD (vs 3-4 days traditional)
    - Authentication system: 1-2 days (vs 5-7 days traditional)
    
    With AI assistance, we can deliver ~3-4x more features in same timeline!
    
    Create proposed-features-analysis.md:
    
    ## Total Features Identified: [X]
    ## Features Selected for MVP: [Y] (can now be ~60-70% of total)
    
    ## Development Approach: AI-Assisted with Claude Code
    This dramatically reduces development time by 70-80%
    
    ## MVP Features (Proposed for $20k/2-month project)
    - [Feature 1]: [2-3 line description]
      - AI-assisted effort: X days (Traditional: Y days)
      - Why essential: [business justification]
    - [Feature 2-N]: [continue - can include many more features now]
    
    ## Deferred Features (Phase 2)
    - [Only truly complex or non-essential features]
    [Should be much shorter list due to AI efficiency]
    
    ## AI-Assisted Timeline Analysis
    - MVP features total: ~5 weeks AI-assisted dev time
    - Integration & testing: 2 weeks (some tasks still manual)
    - Polish & deployment: 1 week
    - Total: 8 weeks
    
    ## Cost Efficiency
    - More features delivered for same $20k budget
    - 3-4x productivity gain with AI assistance
    
    Report: "[COMPLETE] Selected [Y] of [X] features for AI-assisted MVP"
```

#### Step 1.2: Launch Business Value Agent
```

       - Value to end users
       - Competitive advantage
       - Potential ROI/metrics
    
    Create business-value-analysis.md:
    - Value propositions mapped to features
    - Expected business outcomes

## Important Note on Workflow Sequence

This proposal workflow comes **after** the research workflow and **before** the implementation plan workflow. The sequence is:

1. **Project Research** → Understand requirements and market
2. **Client Proposal** → Get client approval on features and approach (THIS WORKFLOW)
3. **Implementation Plan** → Create detailed technical specifications (only after approval)
4. **Project Scaffolding** → Build the actual project

This ensures we get client buy-in on the proposed features before investing time in detailed technical planning. The proposal focuses on business value and feature descriptions rather than technical implementation details.

## Critical: AI-Assisted MVP Feature Selection

This workflow leverages AI-assisted development to deliver **significantly more features** than traditional development. The Feature Prioritization Agent should:

1. Identify ALL features from requirements (often 20-30+ features)
2. Select 15-20 features (60-70% of total) that fit within $20k/2-month with AI assistance
3. Use AI productivity multipliers (3-5x faster) for accurate time estimates
4. Justify the expanded scope based on AI efficiency gains
5. Focus on delivering a feature-rich MVP that maximizes value

Key Time Estimates with AI:
- Simple CRUD: 0.5-1 day (vs 3-5 days traditional)
- Complex features: 2-3 days (vs 8-10 days traditional)  
- UI components: 0.25-0.5 days (vs 2-3 days traditional)
- Testing: 3x faster with AI-generated tests

Remember: AI assistance allows us to deliver more value for the same investment, giving clients a competitive advantage.
