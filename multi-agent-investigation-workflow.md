# Multi-Agent Investigation & Analysis Workflow

## Overview

This document describes a workflow for efficiently executing complex investigation and analysis tasks by coordinating multiple specialized agents using Claude Code MCP (`mcp__ccm__claude_code`) and Chat MCP (`mcp__chat__agent_communication_*`).

**Target Audience**: This document serves as a guide for Claude Code to execute multi-agent investigation and analysis.

**Application Areas**: 
- Large-scale codebase investigation
- System design analysis
- Document integration and organization
- Architecture investigation
- Security audits
- Performance analysis

## Core Principles of the Workflow

### 1. Adaptive Specialization
- **Initial Design**: Divide into 4-6 specialized areas
- **Dynamic Expansion**: Add agents based on discoveries during investigation
- **Optimal Deployment**: Maximize utilization of each agent's expertise

### 2. Continuous Execution Protocol
- **Automatic Termination Prevention**: Continue waiting until explicit termination instruction
- **Adaptive Check Intervals**: Phased intervals (Initial 2min → Mid 3min → Late 5min)
- **Timeout Management**: Maximum execution time limit of 60-90 minutes

### 3. Collective Intelligence Integration
- **Parallel Investigation**: Simultaneous progress in multiple areas
- **Cross-referencing**: Sharing discoveries and cross-checking
- **High-quality Integration**: Final integration using Opus model

## Workflow Components

### Phase 0: Strategic Design and Environment Preparation

#### 0.1 Analysis of Investigation Target and Identification of Specialized Areas
```
Analysis of Investigation Target Characteristics:
- Technical complexity (code, configuration, documentation)
- Scale (number of files, directory structure)
- Stakeholders (developers, users, administrators)
- Expected deliverables

Examples of Specialized Area Division:
- Codebase Investigation: Architecture, API, UI, DB, Infrastructure
- Document Organization: Design docs, Specifications, Procedures, Test materials
- Security Audit: Authentication, Authorization, Data protection, Network
```

#### 0.2 Chat MCP Room Creation
```bash
# Room naming convention: [project]-[task]-[version]
# Examples: permission-investigation-v2, security-audit-v1
```

#### 0.3 Agent Role Design Template (Optimized Version)
```
Agent [A-Z] ([role-name]) - [Specialized Area] Investigation Lead

[IMPORTANT: Continuous Execution Protocol]
1. Report "TASK_COMPLETED" after task completion
2. Then check chat room "[room-name]" at adaptive intervals:
   - Initial: 2-minute intervals
   - Mid: 3-minute intervals  
   - Late: 5-minute intervals
3. Check for messages from coordinator:
   - "terminate_[agent-id]": Execute termination process
   - "new_task_[agent-id]": Start new task
   - "status_[agent-id]": Report current status
   - Other: Continue waiting
4. Maximum wait time: 60 minutes, No-response timeout: 5 minutes

```

### Phase 1: Phased Investigation Execution (Optimized Version)

#### 1.1 Phased Agent Launch Strategy
```bash
# Phase 1a: Foundation Investigation (Parallel Launch)
Agent A: Architecture & Structure Investigation
Agent D: Documentation & Materials Investigation

# Phase 1b after completion check
# Phase 1b: Specialized Investigation (Conditional Parallel)
Agent B: Implementation Details & Code Investigation (after A completes)
Agent C: Configuration & Rules Investigation (Independent)
Agent E,F: Specialized Directory Investigation (after D completes)

# Phase 1c after all complete
# Phase 1c: Integration Work
Agent G: Integrated Report Creation (Opus)
```

#### 1.2 Launch Timing Control Implementation
```bash
# Launch foundation agents
mcp__ccm__claude_code [Agent A prompt] &
mcp__ccm__claude_code [Agent D prompt] &

# Wait for completion (adaptive intervals)
sleep 120  # Initial 2-minute wait
mcp__ccm__list_claude_processes  # Status check

# Conditional branching for next phase launch
if [foundation investigation complete]; then
    mcp__ccm__claude_code [Agent B prompt] &
    mcp__ccm__claude_code [Agent C prompt] &
    # Additional specialized agents (based on discoveries)
fi
```

#### 1.3 Progress Monitoring and Collaboration Management (Optimized Version)
```
Monitoring Intervals (Adaptive):
- Initial stage: 2-minute intervals (stability check after launch)
- Mid stage: 3-minute intervals (during stable operation)
- Late stage: 5-minute intervals (for long-duration work)

Report frequency: Agent's automatic report every 5 minutes
Important discoveries: Immediate chat sharing (urgency classification)

Coordinator's Role:
- Phased progress confirmation (efficient resource management)
- Response to new discoveries
