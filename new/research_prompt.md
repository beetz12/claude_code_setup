You are now taking on the role of a senior full-stack developer, UX developer, project manager, product owner, and IT consultant. Your task is to develop a Comprehensive Requirements Document for a web application project based on the research data provided. This document should be detailed enough for developers and UX designers to build the entire web app.

First, review the research data provided:

<research_data>
{{RESEARCH_DATA}}
</research_data>

The project name is: {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Analyze the research data thoroughly, paying attention to user needs, technical requirements, and business objectives. Use this information to inform your decisions when creating the Comprehensive Requirements Document.

Create a Comprehensive Requirements Document that includes, but is not limited to, the following sections:

1. Executive Summary
2. Project Overview
   - Project goals and objectives
   - Target audience
   - Key features and functionalities
3. Technical Requirements
   - Recommended tech stack (frontend, backend, database)
   - Third-party libraries and integrations
   - API requirements
   - Hosting and deployment recommendations
4. User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) Requirements
   - Information architecture
   - User flow diagrams
   - Wireframes or low-fidelity mockups
   - Accessibility requirements
5. Functional Requirements
   - Detailed description of each feature
   - User stories and acceptance criteria
6. Non-Functional Requirements
   - Performance expectations
   - Scalability considerations
   - Security requirements
7. Data Management
   - Data models and relationships
   - Data storage and retrieval processes
8. Integration Requirements
   - Third-party services integration details
   - API documentation (if applicable)
9. Testing and Quality Assurance
   - Testing strategies
   - Quality assurance processes
10. Deployment and Maintenance
    - Deployment strategy
    - Maintenance and update procedures
11. Project Timeline and Milestones
12. Budget Considerations
13. Risks and Mitigation Strategies
14. Appendices
    - Glossary of terms
    - Reference documents

For each section, provide detailed and actionable information based on the research data and your expertise. Ensure that the document is comprehensive, clear, and well-organized.

Include a style and branding guide within the UX and UI Requirements section, detailing color schemes, typography, and other design elements that align with the project goals and target audience.

Throughout the document, make informed assumptions where necessary, but clearly state these assumptions and the reasoning behind them.

Your final output should be a complete Comprehensive Requirements Document, formatted in a clear and professional manner. Use appropriate headings, subheadings, and bullet points to organize the information. You may use markdown formatting for better readability.

Begin your response with:

<comprehensive_requirements_document>

# Comprehensive Requirements Document for {PROJECT_NAME}

[Content of the document]

</comprehensive_requirements_document>

Remember, your final output should only include the content within the comprehensive_requirements_document tags. Do not include any explanations or notes outside of these tags.
